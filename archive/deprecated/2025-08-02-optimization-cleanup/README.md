# xanadOS Script Optimization Cleanup - August 2, 2025

## Overview
This directory contains scripts that were replaced during the optimization process.

## Archived Scripts

### Original Scripts (replaced by optimized versions)
- `audio-latency-optimizer-original.sh` - Original audio optimization script (605 lines)
- `priority3-hardware-optimization-original.sh` - Original Priority 3 script (648 lines) 
- `priority4-user-experience-original.sh` - Original Priority 4 script (1070 lines)

### Optimization Process
These scripts were optimized using the shared library system (`scripts/lib/setup-common.sh`) resulting in:
- **Audio Latency Optimizer**: 605 → 367 lines (39% reduction)
- **Priority 3 Hardware**: 648 → 473 lines (27% reduction) 
- **Priority 4 User Experience**: 1070 → 421 lines (61% reduction)
- **Total Code Reduction**: 1,062 lines saved (46% overall reduction)

### Replacement Files
The original scripts have been replaced with their optimized counterparts:
- `audio-latency-optimizer.sh` (now points to optimized version)
- `priority3-hardware-optimization.sh` (now points to optimized version)
- `priority4-user-experience.sh` (now points to optimized version)

### Dependencies
All optimized scripts depend on:
- `scripts/lib/setup-common.sh` - Shared library with 430+ reusable functions
- `scripts/lib/common.sh` - Base color and utility functions
- `scripts/lib/validation.sh` - Input validation functions
- `scripts/lib/gaming-env.sh` - Gaming environment functions

## Restoration
If needed, these archived scripts can be restored. However, the optimized versions provide the same functionality with improved maintainability and reduced code duplication.
