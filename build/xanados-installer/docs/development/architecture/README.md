# Architecture Documentation

Core system design and technical architecture documentation for xanadOS.

## Overview

This section contains documentation about the fundamental design decisions, system architecture, and technical frameworks that form the foundation of xanadOS.

## Documents

### [Project Structure](project_structure.md)
Complete directory and file organization documentation. Covers the modular structure of the xanadOS project, including scripts, libraries, documentation, and configuration files.

**Key Topics:**
- Directory hierarchy and organization
- File naming conventions
- Module relationships and dependencies
- Standard locations for different file types

### [Performance Testing Suite](performance-testing-suite.md)
Testing framework architecture and design documentation. Describes the comprehensive testing system used to validate gaming performance and system optimization.

**Key Topics:**

- Automated testing workflows
- Performance benchmarking methodology
- Validation and reporting systems

## Design Principles

### Modular Architecture
- **Library-based system**: Core functionality organized in shared libraries
- **Clean dependencies**: Clear separation of concerns between modules
- **Reusable components**: Functions designed for use across multiple scripts

### Gaming-Focused Design
- **Performance-first approach**: Every component optimized for gaming performance
- **Hardware-aware optimization**: Detection and optimization for specific hardware configurations
- **Gaming platform integration**: Native support for Steam, Lutris, and other gaming platforms

### Quality Assurance
- **Comprehensive testing**: Automated validation at multiple levels
- **Multi-format reporting**: HTML, JSON, and Markdown output for different use cases
- **Documentation-driven**: All components thoroughly documented
