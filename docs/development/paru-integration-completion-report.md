xpkg hardware        # Auto-detect and install hardware packages
xpkg update          # Update entire system (repos + AUR)
```

### 2. Performance Optimizations
```ini
# Gaming-optimized paru configuration
CFlags = -march=native -O2 -pipe -fno-plt -fstack-protector-strong
MFlags = -j$(nproc)  # Use all CPU cores
CompressXZ = --threads=0  # Parallel compression
```

### 3. Hardware Detection
```bash
# Automatic detection and package installation
- NVIDIA: 67 optimization packages
- AMD: 90 optimization packages
- Intel: 99 optimization packages
```

### 4. Gaming Profiles
```bash
# Complete environment setups
- Esports: 116 packages (CS2, Valorant, competitive gaming)
- Streaming: 149 packages (OBS, content creation tools)
- Development: 155 packages (Game engines, IDEs, dev tools)
```
