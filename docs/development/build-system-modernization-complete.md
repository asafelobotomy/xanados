## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### 1. Native Build

```bash
# Build all targets
./build/automation/build-pipeline.sh --all

# Build specific target
./build/automation/build-pipeline.sh --target x86-64-v3

# Dry run mode
./build/automation/build-pipeline.sh --dry-run --target x86-64-v4
```

### 2. Containerized Build

```bash
# Build container environment
./build/containers/container-manager.sh build

# Build all targets in container
./build/containers/container-manager.sh build-all

# Interactive container access
./build/containers/container-manager.sh exec
```

### 3. Testing and Validation

```bash
# Run integration tests
./build/automation/integration-test.sh

# Test specific ISO
./build/automation/test-iso.sh path/to/build.iso

# Release management
./build/automation/release-manager.sh --version 1.0.0 --create
```
