- **Gaming-Focused Design**: Specific focus on gaming performance

### ⚠️ Optimization Opportunities

#### 1. Repository Structure Duplicates
**Issue:** Significant file duplication found
```
- 161 shell scripts total
- 20+ backup files (.backup-20250803-000002)
- Duplicate implementations in build/ vs root directories
- Archive directory contains 2+ deprecated versions
```

**Impact:** Maintenance overhead, build confusion, storage waste

#### 2. Missing 2025 Gaming Technologies
**Research Finding:** Leading gaming distributions now include:
```
CachyOS Features:
- BORE Scheduler (Burst-Oriented Response Enhancer)
- x86-64-v3/v4 optimized packages with LTO
- LLVM Propeller optimization
- Gaming-specific kernel compilation flags

Bazzite Features:
- HDR support
- VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) optimization
- Steam Deck compatibility layer
- Improved anti-cheat compatibility
```

#### 3. Kernel Optimization Gap
**Current:** Standard linux-zen kernel
**Industry Standard:** Customized gaming kernels with:
- BORE scheduler for gaming workloads
- Reduced tick rate (300Hz)
- Gaming-optimized memory management
- PDS/BMQ scheduler options

#### 4. Package Compilation Optimization
**Current:** Standard x86_64 packages
**Opportunity:** x86-64-v3 optimized packages (+10-15% performance)

## Comprehensive Optimization Plan

### Phase 1: Repository Cleanup (Immediate)

#### 1.1 Duplicate File Elimination
```bash
# Remove backup files older than 30 days
find . -name "*.backup*" -mtime +30 -delete

# Consolidate build directories
merge build/xanados-installer/ -> build/
remove redundant script copies

# Archive deprecated content
move archive/deprecated/* to single archive location
```

#### 1.2 Script Consolidation
**Target:** Reduce 161 scripts by 30% through merging
```
Merge candidates:
- install-steam.sh + install-lutris.sh → gaming-platforms-installer.sh
- Multiple demo scripts → single demo framework
- Hardware optimization scattered scripts → unified hw-optimization
```

### Phase 2: Advanced Gaming Kernel Implementation

- linux-tkg-pds (alternative high-performance scheduler)
```

#### 2.2 Gaming-Specific Kernel Parameters
**Research-Based Optimizations:**
```bash
# /etc/kernel/cmdline.additions
processor.max_cstate=1      # Reduce CPU latency
intel_idle.max_cstate=1     # Intel-specific low latency
amd_iommu=pt               # AMD performance mode
default_hugepagesz=1G      # Gaming memory optimization
hugepagesz=1G hugepages=4  # Allocate 4GB huge pages
mitigations=off            # Performance over security (gaming option)
```

### Phase 3: Modern Gaming Technology Stack
