# xanadOS

A specialized Arch Linux-based gaming distribution optimized for performance and security.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** - Phase 1: Foundation & Tooling Complete

Current development focuses on gaming environment setup, hardware optimization, and development tooling.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Set up development environment
./scripts/setup/dev-environment.sh

# Install gaming platforms
./scripts/setup/install-steam.sh
./scripts/setup/install-lutris.sh
./scripts/setup/install-gamemode.sh

# Run gaming setup wizard
./scripts/setup/gaming-setup-wizard.sh

# Generate reports (performance, gaming, system)
./scripts/testing/reports.sh
```

## Features

- **Gaming Optimization**: Steam, Lutris, GameMode integration
- **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive system and gaming performance reports  
- **Hardware Optimization**: Graphics drivers, audio latency, device optimization
