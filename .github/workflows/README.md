# xanadOS GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains the consolidated and optimized GitHub Actions workflows for the xanadOS project. The workflows have been streamlined for better performance, reduced redundancy, and enhanced functionality.

## 🚀 Active Workflows

### 1. **Core Pipeline** (`core-pipeline.yml`)

**Primary CI/CD workflow for development and testing**

- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop/feature branches, PRs, daily schedule, manual dispatch
- **Features**:
  - Smart change detection and conditional execution
  - Parallel validation (syntax, quality, security, documentation)
  - Progressive testing (unit → integration → system)
  - Multi-target builds with caching
  - Comprehensive security scanning
  - Intelligent artifact management

**Pipeline Types**:

- `quick`: Fast validation for PRs
- `full`: Comprehensive testing and building
- `security`: Security-focused analysis
- `nightly`: Complete testing with all targets

### 2. **Build Multi-Target** (`build-multi-target.yml`)

**Specialized multi-architecture ISO building**

- **Triggers**: Build-related file changes, releases, daily schedule, manual dispatch
- **Features**:
  - Matrix-based multi-target building
  - Configurable target selection
  - Build testing and validation
  - Container environment support
  - Artifact management with retention policies

**Supported Targets**: x86-64-v3, x86-64-v4, compatibility

### 3. **Release & Maintenance** (`release-maintenance.yml`)

**Automated release creation and system maintenance**

- **Triggers**: Version tags, releases, weekly/daily schedule, manual dispatch
- **Features**:
  - Automated release creation with ISO building
  - Security assessment and compliance checking
  - Dependency management and updates
  - System maintenance and cleanup
  - Multi-operation support (release, security-update, dependency-update, maintenance)

**Operation Types**:

- `release`: Create tagged releases with full validation
- `security-update`: Apply security-focused updates
- `dependency-update`: Update package dependencies
- `maintenance`: System cleanup and documentation updates

- ✅ **Dynamic matrix generation** based on changes and triggers
- ✅ **Intelligent notifications** and comprehensive reporting
- ✅ **Security-first approach** with continuous monitoring
- ✅ **Automated maintenance** with scheduled operations

### **Consolidation Benefits**

- 🔄 **Eliminated redundancy** - Reduced from 6 to 3 core workflows
- ⚡ **Improved performance** - Parallel execution and smart caching
- 🛡️ **Enhanced security** - Integrated security scanning throughout
- 📦 **Better artifact management** - Intelligent retention and organization
- 🔧 **Simplified maintenance** - Consolidated logic and configurations

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Quick Development Validation

```bash
# Triggered automatically on PR creation
# Uses core-pipeline.yml with "quick" mode
```

### Full Integration Testing

```bash
# Manual dispatch of core-pipeline.yml
gh workflow run core-pipeline.yml -f pipeline_type=full
```

### Custom Build Targets

```bash
# Manual dispatch of build-multi-target.yml
gh workflow run build-multi-target.yml -f targets="x86-64-v3,x86-64-v4"
```

### Create Release

```bash
# Manual dispatch of release-maintenance.yml
gh workflow run release-maintenance.yml -f operation_type=release -f release_version=v1.0.0
```

### Security Updates

```bash
# Manual dispatch of release-maintenance.yml
gh workflow run release-maintenance.yml -f operation_type=security-update
```

## 📈 Monitoring and Reports

Each workflow generates comprehensive reports available as artifacts:

- **Pipeline Report**: Complete execution summary with metrics
- **Security Assessment**: Detailed security analysis and compliance
- **Build Artifacts**: ISO images with metadata and checksums
- **Operation Reports**: Release and maintenance operation summaries

## 🔄 Migration from Previous Workflows

The following workflows have been **consolidated and removed**:

- ❌ `ci-cd-pipeline.yml` → ✅ Merged into `core-pipeline.yml`
- ❌ `release-automation.yml` → ✅ Merged into `release-maintenance.yml`
- ❌ `security-monitoring.yml` → ✅ Integrated into both core workflows
- ❌ `nightly-builds.yml` → ✅ Integrated into `core-pipeline.yml`
- ❌ `dependency-updates.yml` → ✅ Merged into `release-maintenance.yml`

**Benefits of consolidation**:

- 🔄 **50% reduction** in workflow files
- ⚡ **Improved performance** through shared jobs and caching
- 🛡️ **Better security** integration throughout all operations
- 📊 **Unified reporting** and artifact management
- 🔧 **Simplified maintenance** and configuration

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate pipeline types** for different scenarios
2. **Leverage caching** by consistent file organization
3. **Monitor artifact retention** to manage storage costs
4. **Review security reports** regularly
5. **Test manual dispatches** before relying on automation
